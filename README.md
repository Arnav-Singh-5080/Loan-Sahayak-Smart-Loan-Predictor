# 🏦 AI-Powered Smart Loan Approval Prediction System

### End-to-End Machine Learning Project with Deployment

Loan Sahayak is an end-to-end Machine Learning system that automates loan approval decisions using predictive analytics.
The project replicates a real-world banking decision pipeline — from data preprocessing to model deployment — using industry-standard tools.

Built with a focus on **scalability, interpretability, and deployment readiness**.

## 📘 1. Business Problem

Financial institutions must assess loan applications efficiently while minimizing default risk.

This project transforms loan approval into a **Binary Classification Problem**:

* **1 → Loan Approved**
* **0 → Loan Rejected**

The system predicts approval likelihood based on applicant income, credit history, loan amount, and demographic attributes.

## 🧠 2. Machine Learning Approach

### 📊 Data Processing

* Handled missing values using statistical imputation
* Encoded categorical variables (One-Hot / Label Encoding)
* Standardized numerical features
* Removed multicollinearity and irrelevant features

### 🧮 Feature Engineering

* Combined income features for better financial representation
* Transformed categorical credit attributes
* Identified high-impact predictors through correlation analysis

### 🤖 Model Development

* Implemented classification model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest — update accordingly)
* Performed train-test split validation
* Evaluated using Accuracy Score
* Serialized model using `joblib` for deployment

## 🌐 3. Deployment Architecture

* Built interactive web interface using **Streamlit**
* Integrated trained model (`loan_model.pkl`)
* Enabled real-time predictions
* Structured app for cloud deployment

Run locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Deployment-ready for:

* Streamlit Cloud

## 📊 6. Example Prediction Flow

User Inputs → Feature Processing → Model Prediction → Approval Decision

✔ Applicant with strong credit + stable income → Higher approval probability
✘ Applicant with weak credit history → Higher rejection probability

---
